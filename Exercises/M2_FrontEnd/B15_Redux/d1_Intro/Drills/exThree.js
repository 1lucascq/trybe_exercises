  // Writing a Redux action is as simple as declaring an object with a type property. Declare an object action and give it a property type set to the string 'LOGIN'.
  // An action object should exist.
  // The action object should have a key property type with value LOGIN.

  // Define an action here:
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN',
}
